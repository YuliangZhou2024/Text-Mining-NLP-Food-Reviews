# Text-Mining-NLP-Food-Reviews
This project includes a text mining and NLP analysis of food reviews, including TF-IDF vectorization and Naive Bayes classifier techniques. 
It was my Coursework project for COMP42415 at Durham University

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze and classify food reviews using text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The analysis uses TF-IDF vectorization to transform text data into numerical features, and a Naive Bayes classifier is applied to predict the sentiment of the reviews.

## Methodology

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text data into numerical format by evaluating the importance of each word in the corpus.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: A probabilistic model used for text classification, suitable for handling text data due to its simplicity and efficiency.
- **Sampling Approaches**: The project compares random sampling and stratified sampling to evaluate model performance under different data distributions.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used in the analysis.
- `src/`: Includes the main Jupyter Notebook with the analysis code.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and setup instructions.
